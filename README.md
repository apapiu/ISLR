Exercises and Labs from Introduction to Statistical Learning

A selection of labs and exercises from the excellent book [_Introduction to Statistical Learning_](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.
Many of the exercises focus on a particular statistical learning technique but I've tried to use different techniques for each question/dataset
and see how they compare.
